# Packaging vs. Silicon Trade-off Report

## The "Heat Sink" Dividend
By improving the thermal path to ambient (better heat sink/TIM), we can significantly reduce the silicon footprint required to survive 10 years.

### Comparison
| Configuration | Package K | Description | Required Silicon Area |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Standard** | ~2.0 | Plastic/Grease | **30000 um²** |
| **Advanced** | ~8.0 | Vapor Chamber/Solder | **30000 um²** |

### Verdict
Upgrading the cooling solution saves **0 um² (0.0%)** of silicon area per lane.
