- **Skill: Spectral AI**: Deep understanding of Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) for 1D signal modeling.
- **Skill: High-Speed SerDes Knowledge**: Familiarity with PAM4 RLM, UI-to-picosecond conversion, and the "CDR Tax."
- **Skill: Thermal Modeling**: Ability to translate power (mW) to temperature (C) via RC networks.
- **Skill: Evolutionary Reflection**: Using LLM "Co-Reasoning" (GEPA) to adjust hyper-parameters based on physical failures.
